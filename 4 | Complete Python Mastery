1.12 - Quiz
# 1. What is an expression?
## Answer: An expression is a piece of code that produces a value
# 2. Here is an expression, what do you think it's value is?
#    "*" * 3
## Answer: ***
# 3. What is a syntax error?
## Answer: A syntax error is a type of error that is due to bad syntax or bad grammar in the code
# 4. What does a linter do?
## Answer: A linter is a tool that checks our code for potential errors. Mostly in the category of syntactical errors. So if you have grammatical issues in our code, the linter will tell us before running our code.

2.1 - Variables
students_count = 1000  # Integer
rating = 4.99  # Float
is_published = False  # Boolean Values (True or False) - Capitalize
course_name = "Python Programming" # String
print(students_count)
print(rating)
print(is_published)

2.2 - Variable Names
students_count = 1000
rating = 4.99
is_published = True
course_name = "Python Programming"

# What are the four things consistently used in this program?
# Answer:
# 1. All variable names are descriptive and meaningful
# 2. lowercase letters to name variables
# 3. underscore to separate multiple words (no spaces allowed for variables)
# 4. A space around the equal sign

2.3 - Strings
course = "Python Programming"
# you can use double quotes or single quotes, or even triple quotes
message = """
Hi John,

This is Mosh from codewithmosh.com

Blah Blah Blah
"""

# calling (using) a function called length.
# Functions take arguments (inputs to these functions) [like 'course' below]
print(len(course))

# For access to a specific character, use square brackets []
# 0 is the first index number
print(course[0])

# you can also do negatives - it will start from the end first
print(course[-1])

# range of numbers in the indexes are not inclusive
# meaning this one will take the first 3 characters (0,1,2 or Pyt)
print(course[0:3])

# You can see below this will start at the third character and go to the end.
print(course[2:])

# Here you will start from the beginning and go to the thrid character
print(course[:3])

# If you don't put either, it will give a copy of the original string
print(course[:])

2.4 - Escape Sequences

# \ - the backslash is an escape character
# meaning the character after the backslash
course = "Python \"Programming"
# another way to write this would be to use single quotes around the string
print(course)

# Other escape sequences
## \" - for (")
## \' - for (')
## \\ - for (\)
## \n - for new line

2.5 - Formatted Strings
