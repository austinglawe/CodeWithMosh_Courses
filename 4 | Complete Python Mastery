1.5 - Create Your First Pyton Program
print("Hello World")
print("*" * 10)

1.8 - Formatting Python Code
x = 1
y = 2
unit_price = 3

1.9 - Running Python Code
print("Hello World!")
# press Ctrl + Alt + N

1.12 - Quiz
# 1. What is an expression?
## Answer: An expression is a piece of code that produces a value
# 2. Here is an expression, what do you think it's value is?
#    "*" * 3
## Answer: ***
# 3. What is a syntax error?
## Answer: A syntax error is a type of error that is due to bad syntax or bad grammar in the code
# 4. What does a linter do?
## Answer: A linter is a tool that checks our code for potential errors. Mostly in the category of syntactical errors. So if you have grammatical issues in our code, the linter will tell us before running our code.

2.1 - Variables
students_count = 1000  # Integer
rating = 4.99  # Float
is_published = False  # Boolean Values (True or False) - Capitalize
course_name = "Python Programming" # String
print(students_count)
print(rating)
print(is_published)

2.2 - Variable Names
students_count = 1000
rating = 4.99
is_published = True
course_name = "Python Programming"

# What are the four things consistently used in this program?
# Answer:
# 1. All variable names are descriptive and meaningful
# 2. lowercase letters to name variables
# 3. underscore to separate multiple words (no spaces allowed for variables)
# 4. A space around the equal sign

2.3 - Strings
course = "Python Programming"
# you can use double quotes or single quotes, or even triple quotes
message = """
Hi John,

This is Mosh from codewithmosh.com

Blah Blah Blah
"""

# calling (using) a function called length.
# Functions take arguments (inputs to these functions) [like 'course' below]
print(len(course))

# For access to a specific character, use square brackets []
# 0 is the first index number
print(course[0])

# you can also do negatives - it will start from the end first
print(course[-1])

# range of numbers in the indexes are not inclusive
# meaning this one will take the first 3 characters (0,1,2 or Pyt)
print(course[0:3])

# You can see below this will start at the third character and go to the end.
print(course[2:])

# Here you will start from the beginning and go to the thrid character
print(course[:3])

# If you don't put either, it will give a copy of the original string
print(course[:])

2.4 - Escape Sequences

# \ - the backslash is an escape character
# meaning the character after the backslash
course = "Python \"Programming"
# another way to write this would be to use single quotes around the string
print(course)

# Other escape sequences
## \" - for (")
## \' - for (')
## \\ - for (\)
## \n - for new line

2.5 - Formatted Strings
first = "Mosh"
last = "Hamedani"
full = first + " " + last
print(full)
full = f"{first} {last}"
print(full)
full = f"{len(first)} {last}"
print(full)
full = f"{len(first)} {2 + 2}"
print(full)

2.6 - String Methods
course = "  PytHon Programming  "
# Everything in python is an obaject.
# Objects have 'functions' called methods
# .upper to convert all characters to uppercase
print(course.upper())
# methods don't change the original 'course' variable
print(course)
# .lower to convert all to lowercase
print(course.lower())
# .title will make the first letter of each word capitalized and the rest lowercase
print(course.title())
# .strip will get rid of any 'white' space - meaning any unnecassary spaces
print(course.strip())
# .lstrip - removes from the beginning of the string
print(course.lstrip())
# .rstrip - removes from the end of the string
print(course.rstrip())
# .find - index of 'Pro' - position - where it starts (remember 0 is position 1)
print(course.find("Pro"))
# if it is not found in the index, it will equal -1
print(course.find("pro"))
# .replace will whaterver you put first with the one you put second
print(course.replace("P", "J"))
# expression (peice of code that produces a value) 'in' -- returns a Boolean value (True or False)
print("Pro" in course)
# 'Not' Operator. To see if it does or doesn't contain [a] character(s)
print("Swift" not in course)

2.7 - Numbers
# integers (non decimal)
x = 1
# floats (decimals)
x = 1.1
# complex numbers (i = imaginary number)
x = 1 + 2j  # a + bi
# Addition (+)
print(10 + 3)
# Subtraction (-)
print(10 - 3)
# Multiplication (*)
print(10 * 3)
# Division (Floating point number)
print(10 / 3)
# Divsion (Integer)
print(10 // 3)
# Remainder of the division
print(10 % 3)
# Exponent (left to the power of right)
print(10 ** 3)

# Augmented Assignment Operator
# x = 10, These two are the exact same: "x = x + 3" = "x += 3"
x = 10
print(x)
x = x + 3
print(x)

x = 10
print(x)
x += 3
print(x)

2.8 - Working with Numbers
# round function, will round the value
print(round(2.9))

# abs function will give the absolute value
print(abs(-2.9))

# only so many build in functions for more:
# use modules like the math module
# A module is like a separate file with some Python code.

import math
math.ceil(2.2)
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html

2.9 - Type Conversion
# Integer
# int(x)

# Float
# float(x)

# Boolean
# bool(x)

# String
# str(x)

# x = input("X: ")
# print(type(x))

x = input("X: ")
y = int(x) + 1
print(f"x: {x}, y: {y}")

# For Boolean values there are falsy and truthy
# Falsy
# "" - empty strings, 0, None - an absence of value
bool(0) # False
bool(1) # True
bool(-1) # True
bool(5) # True
bool("") # False
bool("False") # True

2.10 - Quiz
# 1. What are the built in primitive types in python?
## Answer: Strings, Booleans, and Numbers. (Numbers can be integers, floats, or complex numbers)
# 2. We have this variable fruit, set to "Apple", what will we see in the terminal when we execute the code.
# fruit = "Apple"
# print(fruit[1])
## Answer: p
# 3. What about if we add a colon and -1 like:
# fruit = "Apple"
# print(fruit[1:-1])
## Answer: ppl -- after the colon is not inclusive.
# 4. What is the result of this expression:
# 10 % 3
## Answer: 1
# 5. What will we see when we execute this code:
# print(bool("False"))
## Answer: True

3.1 - Comparison Operators
print(10 > 3)  # True
print(10 >= 3)  # True
print(10 < 20)  # True
print(10 <= 20)  # True
print(10 == 10)  # True
print(10 == "10")  # False
print(10 != "10")  # True
print("bag" > "apple")  # True (because it goes alphabetical order)
print("bag" == "BAG")  # False
# the reason this is false is that every character has it's own numerical representation.
print(ord("b"))
print(ord("a"))
print(ord("B"))
print("Bag" > "apple")
